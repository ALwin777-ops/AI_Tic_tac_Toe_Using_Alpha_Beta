# 🕹️ **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)**
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and Tkinter, featuring an AI opponent powered by the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The game is simple, intuitive, and offers a challenging experience for players.

## 🎯 Features
### ✅ Player vs AI Mode

You play as Player X against the AI (Player O).
The AI uses the Minimax Algorithm to ensure the best possible move.
### ✅ Smart AI Logic

The AI evaluates moves using Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize its decision-making.
### ✅ Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Simple and interactive UI built with Tkinter.
Buttons dynamically update as the game progresses.
### ✅ Automatic Win/Tie Detection

The game checks for winning conditions after every move.
It detects ties if the board is full with no winner.
### ✅ Reset Button

Restart the game without closing the application.



## 🚀 How It Works
### 1) Minimax Algorithm:

The AI simulates all possible moves and selects the best one using Minimax.
Alpha-Beta Pruning optimizes the search by cutting off irrelevant branches.
### 2) Winning Conditions:

The game checks all rows, columns, and diagonals for a win.
### 3) Player and AI Turns:

You play by clicking a button on the game board.
The AI calculates its move instantly and plays accordingly.
